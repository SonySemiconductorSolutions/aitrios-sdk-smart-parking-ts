Training Smart Parking
======================

Training the system allows the Smart Parking application to identify objects and refine detection of vehicles in parking spaces.

You can capture your own images to train the system, or for a quick start, Smart Parking provides precaptured images that you can use to train the system in a ``training_images.zip`` archive.

During detection, the Custom Vision Object Detection model is used. Any detected object is taken into account, even if it is not car or vehicle.

For more information, please refer to "3.6 Train model" in the Console User Manual.

.. note::

     If you're using your own training images and your own model, you'll need to set the ``ModelId`` parameter of your Command Parameter File appropriately before uploading it to the Console for AITRIOS.
