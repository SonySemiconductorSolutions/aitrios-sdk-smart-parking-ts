Using Smart Parking
===================

.. _starttool:

Starting Smart Parking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. The process for starting Smart Parking varies depending on your implementation:

    - If you're running a Docker image or running local instances of the front and backend, go to ``localhost:8080`` to use the default port.

     .. note::

       Your implementation can also use a custom port. For more information see :ref:`environment`.

    - If you're running Smart Parking inside Containers or Codespaces, go to the redirected port.

    - If you're running a cloud deployment, please refer to the documentation for your specific deployment.
 
#. In the **Enter device name** box, provide the device name of the Edge AI device you want to use.


.. _offline:

Using Offline Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An offline mode is provided to demonstrate Smart Parking without an Internet connection or Edge AI device.

In offline mode, the system runs using prerecorded data. Please note the following limitations:

   - *Offline Mode* is displayed in the interface.
   
   - You can adjust parking space polygons to demonstrate the functionality, but the adjustments are not applied to the demonstration data.
   
To use Offline Mode, start Smart Parking and type ``mockDevice0`` in the  **Enter device name box**.    

.. _adding:

Adding spaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Start Smart Parking.

#. In the **Enter device name** box, provide the device name of the Edge AI device you want to use.

#. Click the Calibrate tab. The preview shows you the Edge AI device's output.

#. Click **Add space** to add a polygon to the preview.

   .. image:: images/addspace.png
    :width: 500

#. Drag the polygon to place it over a parking space.

#. Drag the corners of the polygon to align its edges with the parking space.

#. Repeat steps 4 through 6 for each parking space.

.. _editing:

Editing spaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Start Smart Parking.

#. In the **Enter device name** box, provide the device name of the Edge AI device you want to use.

#. Click the Calibrate tab. The preview shows you the Edge AI device's output.

#. Select a space on the right side of the screen.

#. Drag the corners of the polygon to align its edges with the parking space.

#. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each parking space.

   .. tip::

      Click **Clear** below the workspace to remove all polygons.   

      You can click **Delete** below the workspace to remove the selected polygon. 
   
      Select a space on the right side of the Calibrate tab and click the **Delete** button |b_delete| to remove it.

.. _viewing:

Viewing vacant and occupied spaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Start Smart Parking.

#. In the **Enter device name** box, provide the device name of the Edge AI device you want to use.

#. Click the Detect tab. The preview shows an overview of the parking spaces and an Edge AI device view with detection rectangles.

#. After detection is complete, a red indicator represents an occupied space, a green indicator represents a vacant space, an orange rectangle represents the detection area, and a blue polygon represents a defined space.

   You can use the **Occupied**, **Vacant**, **Defined spaces**, and **Detection rectangle** switches to customize the display.

   .. tip:: 
      
      Click either image to change the current view.
